# Caesar Cipher in Python

This project implements a basic Caesar Cipher encoder and decoder using Python. It demonstrates how to shift characters in a string to perform simple encryption and decryption.

## 🔐 What is Caesar Cipher?
The Caesar Cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a fixed number of positions down the alphabet.

## 🛠 Features
- Encode text with a given shift
- Decode text using the reverse shift
- Handles both uppercase and lowercase letters
- Ignores non-alphabetic characters (e.g., numbers, punctuation)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x

### How to Run
```bash
python caesar_cipher.py
